speech recognition: naïve, forensic, automatic
tasks:
    identification - identify unknown speaker from a set of known speakers
        closed/in-set - all speakers of a set are known
        open/out-of-set - can be outside from group: universal background model (UBM) is necessary
    verification - unknown speaker claims identity, verify if claim is true
        compare 2 samples and decide if they are from same speaker
            compare unk. sample to 2 alternative models
                speaker model
                world model
text dependant / text independant

human speech: performance biometric - how speech is spoken, not is what is said
large degree of variability: style shifting/intraspeaker variability
recording/transmission aggravates this

sources of variability
    speaker based:
        situational stress
        vocal effort
        emotion
        physiological
        disguise
    conversation based:
        human-human:
            -language/dialect
            -read, spontaneous,...
            -monologue, public speech
        human-machine;
            -prompted
            -voice input for telephone/...
    technology/external based:
        electromechanical
        environmental
        data quality

FEATURES:
ideal properties:
    high between speaker variability and low within speaker variability
    resistant to disguise or mimicry
    high frequency of ocurrence in relevant materials
    robust in transmission
    easy to extract and measure
Auditory: can be heard and objectively described
    utterance of specific sounds
Acoustic: mathematically derived from speech signal
    fundamental frequency, bandwidth
Linguistic: across languages or dialects
    phonological, morphological, syntactic
Non-linguistic: features not related to speech content
    speech quality, fluency, pauses, speaking rate, av. frequency, non speech sounds
Short term: short time span, segmental
Long term: averaged parameters, utterance level

Automatic speaker recognition:

Enrollment Speaker -> Feature Extraction -> Train mathematical model
Unknown speaker -> Feature Extraction -> Compare against model -> Decision (accept/reject)

Voice activity Decisions (VAD) -> extraction only in speech segments

Short Term Features: 20-25ms 
    Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)
        25ms speech frame
        window function (Hamming, Hanning)
        Fourier power spectrum 
        Log of spectrum
        nonlinear Mel-space filter bank analysis (24ch)
        Discrete cosine transform, retaining n values
    Linear predictive coding (LPC)
Feature normalization: retain values in modified acoustic conditions
    cepstral mean subtraction
    feature warmping
    relative specra (RASTA) processing
    quantile based cepstral normalization

Speaker modelling:
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
    clusters data in an unsupervised way, with prob. density function of data
        => speaker dependent PDF
    evaluating PDF at diff. data points (test utterance) 
        => similarity between a speaker GMM and unknown data
    GMM is obtained for each speaker
    Testing: utterance is compared against each GMM
        most likely speaker is selected

GMM-UBM 
    UBM: universal background model
    speaker verification:
        claimed speaker model
        universal background model:
            represents speakers other than the target
    speaker GMM is adapted/derived from UBM usin bayesian adaptation
    LR test:
        feature vector X
        Ns speaker dependent GMM
        N0 UBM
        p(X|Ns)/p(X|N0) compare with threshold
            accept or reject
        Usually in log scale

GMM-supervector:
    concatenate GMM mean vector of Maximum a posteriori adapted speaker model
    fixed dimensional recognition of a single utterance
    
GMM supervector SVMs
    supervectors from training utterances -> positive
    superfectors from impostor utterances -> negative

GMM supervector Factor Analysis (FA)
    describes high dimensional data vectors with low number of hidden variables
    Linear Distortion Model:
        4 components
            speaker/channel/environment independent
                from UBM, constant
            speaker dependent
            channel/environment dependent
            residual
    Classical MAP Adaptation
    Eigenvoice Adaptation
    Eigenchannel Adaptation
    Joint FA
    i-Vector

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
    finds orthogonal directions in feature space that are more effective in discriminating classes

NAP
    feature space transformed using orthogonal projection in channel complementary space

WCCN
    minimizes false alarm and miss-error rates during SVM training
