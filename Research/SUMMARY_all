Look, Listen and Learn — A Multimodal LSTM for Speaker Identification
    Identify who is speaking in a video
    Multimodal LSTM, some weight sharing between faces and sound
        faces: CNN architecture
        sound: MFCC

Advances in deep neural network approaches to speaker recognition
    DNN can be used to:
        extract features
            trained for speech recognition: predict senone posteriors
            bottleneck layer: reduce nodes in hidden layer and use them as features + MFCC
        feature modelling

Deep Neural Network Approaches to Speaker and Language Recognition
    DNN used as:
        direct: classifier for recognition task
        indirect: DNN trained for other purpose used to extract data used to train 
            frame level features
            accumulate multinomial or gaussian vector
            multimodel statistics to train i vector
    DNN classifier
        multilayer perceptron with 2+ hidden layers
        input: stacked set of spectral feats.
            MFCC
            PLP
            short 20ms frames of speech
            context of +/-5 to 10 frames around curent input
        output: predition of posterior prob. of target classes of input frame
    bottleneck: use hidden layer activation as feature vetor
